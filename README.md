# BASIC VID2ASCII
An extremely primitive C++ "program" which makes use of OpenCV to create an ASCII art version of each frame of a video, primarily designed for and tested with the Bad Apple music video.
Created with VS2022 on a Windows 10 machine. No idea if it functions at all on any other OS.
## Usage
Use a command-line interface. Pass the location of your video file as an argument.
Or just drag and drop your video over the program in a GUI file explorer.
## Compiling
